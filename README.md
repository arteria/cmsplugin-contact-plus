# About cmsplugin_contact_plus

[cmsplugin-contact-plus](https://github.com/arteria/cmsplugin-contact-plus/) lets you build forms for your Django CMS project
with exactly the fields you want in the order you want with a minimal effort.

Beside the regular input fields there are "auto" fields, for example to submit the referral page, or additional, hidden values.
The form will be submitted to an email address that is defined per form. This allows to cover a lot of use cases with a single and simple plugin.

cmsplugin-contact-plus is licensed under the MIT License.

## Quickstart

1. To install from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cmsplugin_contact_plus/), in your virtualenv run

	```
	pip install cmsplugin_contact_plus
	```

	or to get the latest commit from GitHub,

	```
	pip install -e git+git://github.com/arteria/cmsplugin-contact-plus.git#egg=cmsplugin_contact_plus
	```


2. Put ``cmsplugin_contact_plus`` in your INSTALLED_APPS `settings.py` section and verify that the [ADMINS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#admins) setting is set as well.

3. Don't forget to migrate your database.
4. Configure Django's [e-mail settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/email/#quick-example) appropriately.

## Configuration/Settings

### ``CONTACT_PLUS_FROM_EMAIL``

Specify ``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`` (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#default-from-email) in your projects settings to send emails from a specific address. Otherwise Django's default  'webmaster@localhost' will be used.

### ``CONTACT_PLUS_REPLY_EMAIL_LABEL``

To set the reply-to header for the email automatically, specify ``CONTACT_PLUS_REPLY_EMAIL_LABEL`` in your project settings. If the label is "your email" for example, then set ``CONTACT_PLUS_REPLY_EMAIL_LABEL='your-email'`` - basically it's the slugified field label that is used to look up the reply-to email address.

### ``CONTACT_PLUS_REQUIRED_CSS_CLASS``

Defines the required CSS class, default is `required`.

### ``CMSPLUGIN_CONTACT_FORM_VALIDATORS``

Specify ``CMSPLUGIN_CONTACT_FORM_VALIDATORS`` in your projects settings to one or more [validator functions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/validators/) that are used with the CharFieldWithValidator field. Expected is a list of strings, each string should point a validator function by its full path. For example:

CMSPLUGIN_CONTACT_FORM_VALIDATORS = [
  'myproject.utils.validators.phone_number_validator',
]

###  ``CONTACT_PLUS_SEND_METHOD``

Specify ``CONTACT_PLUS_SEND_METHOD`` in your settings to specify how email is send.  
the default value is  `cmsplugin_contact_plus.email_manager.default_send_email`

For example if you don't want to send an email, just save records use 

``
CONTACT_PLUS_SEND_METHOD='cmsplugin_contact_plus.email_manager.none_send_email' 
``

you can specify your own email sender 

```
def mysender(**kwargs):
    send_email()
    
```

Available  kwargs arguments

- `from_email`: From email
- `context`':  {data: form data, ordered_data: form data in order, instance: form plugin}
- `subject`: Email subject
- `instance`: form plugin instance"
- `headers`: Http headers (don't use)
- `to`:  TO email list


### reCAPTCHA

To make the reCAPTCHA field type available to your users, add `'captcha'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and define your `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY` and `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY` as described in [django-recaptcha's README](https://github.com/praekelt/django-recaptcha/blob/develop/README.rst). A single reCAPTCHA instance per page is supported.

## Templates

If you are not using the default template settings of Django, make sure that  ``'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader'`` is added to the [`TEMPLATES.OPTIONS.loaders`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/upgrading/#the-templates-settings) list in your `settings.py` file. Likewise, if your Django version is < 1.8, make sure that the above-mentioned loader is in your list of [`TEMPLATE_LOADERS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#template-loaders).

## Features

## Notes

- Migrations are available with django-cms >= 3.0.6 because we depend on [this](https://github.com/divio/django-cms/blob/3.0.6/cms/migrations_django/0003_auto_20140926_2347.py) migrations file.
- Collecting data is not available if ``from.is_multipart is True`` (= the form has attached files)
- If you render a form field manually, make sure that its name is: `name="{{ field.label|slugify }}"`. This is necessary for the proper validation of the form.

- Hidden "referral page" field. Reads referral from request.
- Generic Hidden fields. Use this in combination with JavaScript/jQuery to attach additional data to the form sent by email.

For example, the field lable for the 'CharField as HiddenInput' is named to "Object description".
Using the lable name, the ID for the input field will be 'id_object-description', the name 'object-description'.

Store data is dead easy using jQuery.


	$('#id_object-description').val('Hello Hidden World'); // The string 'Hello Hidden World' will be send by email as well.
