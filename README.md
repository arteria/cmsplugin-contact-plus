[cmsplugin-contact-plus](https://github.com/arteria/cmsplugin-contact-plus/) lets you build forms for your Django CMS project
with exactly the fields you want in the order you want with a minimal effort.

Beside the regular input fields there are "auto" fields, for example to submit the referral page, or additional, hidden values.
The form will be submitted to an email address that is defined per form. This allows to cover a lot of use cases with a single and simple plugin.

From v1.3.5, the plugin is compatible with Django >= 1.5

cmsplugin-contact-plus is licensed under the MIT License.

## Quickstart

1. To install from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cmsplugin_contact_plus/), in your virtualenv run

	```
	pip install cmsplugin_contact_plus
	```

	or to get the latest commit from GitHub,

	```
	pip install -e git+git://github.com/arteria/cmsplugin-contact-plus.git#egg=cmsplugin_contact_plus
	```
2. cmsplugin-contact-plus requires https://github.com/iambrandontaylor/django-admin-sortable as dependency. Please have a look at the "Supported Django Versions", "Installation", and "Configuration" sections of the [README](https://github.com/iambrandontaylor/django-admin-sortable/blob/master/README.md).

3. Put ``cmsplugin_contact_plus`` and ``adminsortable`` in your INSTALLED_APPS `settings.py` section and verify that the [ADMINS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#admins) setting is set as well.

4. Don't forget to migrate your database.
5. Configure Django's [e-mail settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/email/#quick-example) appropriately.

## Configuration/Settings

### ``CONTACT_PLUS_FROM_EMAIL``

Specify ``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`` (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#default-from-email) in your projects settings to send emails from a specific address. Otherwise Django's default  'webmaster@localhost' will be used.

### ``CONTACT_PLUS_REPLY_EMAIL_LABEL``

To set the reply-to header for the email automatically, specify ``CONTACT_PLUS_REPLY_EMAIL_LABEL`` in your project settings. If the label is "your email" for example, then set ``CONTACT_PLUS_REPLY_EMAIL_LABEL='your-email'`` - basically it's the slugified field label that is used to look up the reply-to email address.

### ``CONTACT_PLUS_SEND_COPY_TO_REPLY_EMAIL``

To send a carbon copy to the submitter you can set the ``CONTACT_PLUS_SEND_COPY_TO_REPLY_EMAIL`` to `True`. If a Field with the label `email` exists this email will be used as Cc Header.

### ``CONTACT_PLUS_REQUIRED_CSS_CLASS``

Defines the required CSS class, default is `required`.

### ``CMSPLUGIN_CONTACT_PLUS_TEMPLATES``

To allow users to choose between multiple contact form templates, specify the template choices in your project settings like this:

```python
CMSPLUGIN_CONTACT_PLUS_TEMPLATES = [
    ('cmsplugin_contact_plus/contact.html', 'Contact Form'),
    ('cmsplugin_contact_plus/contact_newsletter.html', 'Newsletter Form'),
]
```

Make sure that the templates can be loaded by Django.

### ``CMSPLUGIN_CONTACT_FORM_VALIDATORS``

Specify ``CMSPLUGIN_CONTACT_FORM_VALIDATORS`` in your projects settings to one or more [validator functions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/validators/) that are used with the CharFieldWithValidator field. Expected is a list of strings, each string should point a validator function by its full path. For example:

```python
CMSPLUGIN_CONTACT_FORM_VALIDATORS = [
  'myproject.utils.validators.phone_number_validator',
]
```

### ``CONTACT_PLUS_SEND_HTML_EMAIL``

Default is `False`. If activated, the notification email is sent as *multipart/alternative*.

### reCAPTCHA

To make the reCAPTCHA field type available to your users, add `'captcha'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and define your `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY` and `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY` as described in [django-recaptcha's README](https://github.com/praekelt/django-recaptcha/blob/develop/README.rst). A single reCAPTCHA instance per page is supported.

## Templates

If you are not using the default template settings of Django, make sure that  ``'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader'`` is added to the [`TEMPLATES.OPTIONS.loaders`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/upgrading/#the-templates-settings) list in your `settings.py` file. Likewise, if your Django version is < 1.8, make sure that the above-mentioned loader is in your list of [`TEMPLATE_LOADERS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#template-loaders).

## Features

- Dynamic form creation
- Migrations included
- Store data in the database
- Multiple languages: currently English and Spanish translations
- reCAPTCHA and simple math captcha
- django CMS 3.0 compatible
- Template support
- Track/pass hidden data
- Signals

## Notes

- Migrations are available with django-cms >= 3.0.6 because we depend on [this](https://github.com/divio/django-cms/blob/3.0.6/cms/migrations_django/0003_auto_20140926_2347.py) migrations file.
- Collecting data is not available if ``from.is_multipart is True`` (= the form has attached files)
- If you render a form field manually, make sure that its name is: `name="{{ field.label|slugify }}"`. This is necessary for the proper validation of the form.

## TODO and planned features .
- Widget support for each field.
- Provide examples and real life case studies
- Formatted email messages, HTML?, .as_p, ?

For example, the field lable for the 'CharField as HiddenInput' is named to "Object description".
Using the lable name, the ID for the input field will be 'id_object-description', the name 'object-description'.

Store data is dead easy using jQuery.


	$('#id_object-description').val('Hello Hidden World'); // The string 'Hello Hidden World' will be send by email as well.
